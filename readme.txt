HOW TO USE THESE FILES

The files provided include:
1. The Phostoshop file -- feel free to alter as you need
2. The final Portfolio theme
3. Two slider examples -- Taken from slidesjs.com and modified

Setting up the Portfolio theme

1. Install wordPress on your localhost or server, delete hello world and the sample page. 
2. Install theme and activate.
3. Create three or more posts. Each post should have a title, content and one or more images. ( 640px x 400px )
4. Create one or more feature projects. Each project should have a title, content, one image which is set as a featured image. ( 640px x 280px ) You can also add a link to the project if you choose to.
5. Create a few pages including a Home page.
6. Go through your settings and under Reading choose a static page as your home page and select Home.
7. Set up your menu. You'll need to create a custom menu for the portfolio and link it to the latest post.

That's it. Once that's done, you can play around with the css, layout and transform your site into something a bit more elegant than http://portfolio-demo.bluelimemedia.com/

Have fun!
